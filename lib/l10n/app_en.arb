  "question1": "An IPTV app requests permission to READ_SMS. What should you do?",
  "question1Option1": "Allow it - SMS access is needed for user verification",
  "question1Option2": "Flag it for review - SMS access is suspicious for IPTV apps",
  "question1Option3": "Install it anyway - the permission might be for a legitimate feature",
  "question1Option4": "Check if the app has good reviews first",
  "question1Explanation": "SMS access is rarely required for IPTV functionality and is a major red flag. This permission could be used to intercept 2FA codes or steal sensitive information. Always flag apps with permission mismatches for manual review.",
  "question1Reference": "Red Flags Guide - Permission Mismatch Analysis",
  "question2": "What is the primary risk of apps requesting ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission?",
  "question2Option1": "They can access the internet",
  "question2Option2": "They can control other apps and steal sensitive data",
  "question2Option3": "They can read device storage",
  "question2Option4": "They can make phone calls",
  "question2Explanation": "Accessibility services can control other applications, simulate user interactions, and steal sensitive data from any app on the device. This is one of the most dangerous permissions and should never be granted to non-essential apps.",
  "question2Reference": "Red Flags Guide - Accessibility Service Abuse",
  "question3": "A VPN app requests permission to READ_CONTACTS. This is:",
  "question3Option1": "Normal - VPN apps need to access contacts for security",
  "question3Option2": "Suspicious - VPN apps should not need contact access",
  "question3Option3": "Required - for user authentication",
  "question3Option4": "Optional - depends on the VPN provider",
  "question3Explanation": "VPN apps do not need access to contacts. This is a clear red flag indicating potential data harvesting or social engineering attacks. Legitimate VPN services do not require contact access.",
  "question3Reference": "Red Flags Guide - VPN/IPTV Disguise",
  "question4": "What does dynamic code loading typically indicate in mobile apps?",
  "question4Option1": "Efficient app performance",
  "question4Option2": "Attempt to evade static analysis",
  "question4Option3": "Better user experience",
  "question4Option4": "Reduced app size",
  "question4Explanation": "Dynamic code loading is often used by malicious apps to download and execute additional payloads after passing initial security checks. This technique helps malware evade static analysis tools.",
  "question4Reference": "Red Flags Guide - Dynamic Code Loading",
  "question5": "An app with very few reviews (less than 10) and a recently created developer account is:",
  "question5Option1": "A new legitimate app",
  "question5Option2": "Potentially suspicious and should be investigated",
  "question5Option3": "Normal for small developers",
  "question5Option4": "A sign of high quality",
  "question5Explanation": "Apps with minimal reviews and recently created developer accounts are common indicators of app store evasion techniques. Malicious apps often use fake or compromised developer accounts to bypass security checks.",
  "question5Reference": "Red Flags Guide - App Store Evasion",
  "question6": "What is the main risk of WebView phishing in mobile apps?",
  "question6Option1": "Slower app performance",
  "question6Option2": "Display of fake login pages to steal credentials",
  "question6Option3": "Increased data usage",
  "question6Option4": "Poor user interface",
  "question6Explanation": "WebView phishing uses WebView components to display convincing fake login pages that steal user credentials. The WebView can be styled to look exactly like legitimate banking or social media apps.",
  "question6Reference": "Red Flags Guide - WebView Phishing",
  "question7": "An app requests REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission. For most apps, this is:",
  "question7Option1": "Required for normal operation",
  "question7Option2": "A critical red flag indicating potential dropper malware",
  "question7Option3": "Needed for app updates",
  "question7Option4": "Standard for all Android apps",
  "question7Explanation": "REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission allows apps to install other packages. This is rarely needed and is a major red flag for potential dropper malware that installs additional malicious apps.",
  "question7Reference": "Red Flags Guide - Installer Flow Abuse",
  "question8": "What should you do if an app's functionality doesn't match its requested permissions?",
  "question8Option1": "Install it anyway - permissions might be for future features",
  "question8Option2": "Flag it for manual review and investigate further",
  "question8Option3": "Check user reviews to see if others had issues",
  "question8Option4": "Contact the developer for clarification",
  "question8Explanation": "Permission mismatches are a major red flag and should always trigger manual review. Apps should only request permissions that are directly related to their stated functionality. This is a common technique used by malicious apps.",
